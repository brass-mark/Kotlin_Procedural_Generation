# Kotlin_Procedural_Generation
A small Kotlin program that generates a very basic 2D list that represents longitude and latitude on the map as the x and y indexes and the altitude as the values in the lists.

## How are the values represented?
- Latitude / first index value (y) (left to right)
- Longitude / second index value (x) (top to bottom)
- Altitude / given value (Int) (single value)

## Notes
- The values to change the bounds are stored as constants at the top of the file, and can be altered without any repercussions. Keep in mind that the ranges and indexes start counting from 0, not 1.
- Feel free to change the code however you like.
